      TRAVEL TIPS
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='body1' align="justify" >
          1.- Consider the season in which you will travel, if the weather is what you expect or if there is a special holiday.<br/>
          2.- When packing your suitcase, consider the days you will be and organize your outfits in bed separately, before putting them in, in this way you will not forget anything.<br/>
          3.- In addition to taking your medicines and creams that you use daily, do not forget to always pack repellent and biodegradable sunscreen.<br/>
          4.-Wherever you go, do not forget to take a copy of your documents such as credential and others that you may require, leave them somewhere safe in your suitcase, in case you lose your wallet. Also, always carry a contact number with you.<br/>
          5.- Do not forget to talk to the local people, no matter how much technology you have or have a guide, the best information will always be given to you by the people who live in that place.<br/>
          6.- Do not buy too many souvenirs, buy only those that you are sure you will only find in that place. If you travel abroad, a very special souvenir is the coins or bills of that nationality.<br/>
          7.- Treat your destination as if it were your own home, do not litter, respect the monuments and their customs. Be a good traveler in every way.<br/>
          8.- Do not forget to put a market on the list of places to visit in your destination. You will be surprised when you visit them because they thoroughly show the customs of the place.<br/>
          9.- Enjoy your destination intensely, disconnect from the phone for a day, leave messages, mails and everything for later, relax naturally.<br/>
          10.- Return from the trip a day before you have to return to work if possible, so you will not have time to rest from the trip and assimilate your return to the routine.

      FLIGHT TIPS
       </Typography>
       <Typography variant='body1' align="justify">
          1.- Buy your flight directly with the airlines, in this way you avoid paying commissions that intermediaries charge for selling tickets.<br/>
          2.- Check the calendar mode to view the best prices in the month and you can choose the most convenient for you.<br/>
          3.- Delete cookies or use the incognito mode so that there is no record of your search and the airlines do not record your visit and can raise prices.<br/>
          4.- Compare round-trip flight prices separately before choosing a round-trip flight in a single purchase.<br/>
          5.- Plan your luggage to choose the correct flight plan and do not pay extras for exceeding the allowed weight.

      TIPS FOR HOTELS
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='body1' align="justify" >
          1.- The simplest advice is perhaps the one that will allow you to get even cheaper hotels than normal, usually the travel seasons are divided into three: High, low and medium. The highest prices will always be in low season, so you can choose to travel in low season.<br/>
          2.- The advice to book in advance is perhaps the second most common advice to get cheap hotels that is usually given but I think that few people understand why, booking in advance gives you the opportunity to have more options to choose from.<br/>
          3.- If it is possible to move your travel days, try to make them from Sunday to Wednesday, these days you will find the cheapest hotel prices.<br/>
          4.- I know that it is very tempting to be close to all the action, but this also means that staying in the city center or near tourist attractions increases the price of hotels considerably.<br/>
          5.- Before clicking the reserve button and getting carried away by the super price that appears on the screen, make sure you read the fine print to see if there are no hidden costs.<br/>
